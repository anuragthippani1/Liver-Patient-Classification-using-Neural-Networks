# Liver-Patient-Classification-using-Neural-Networks

This project implements a neural network (MLPClassifier) to classify patients based on liver health indicators. It includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and a Gradio-based web interface for live predictions.

## Features
- Binary classification using the Iris dataset (Setosa vs Others)
- Scikit-learn MLPClassifier (neural network)
- Data scaling, train-test splitting
- Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report evaluation
- Gradio interface for real-time prediction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Gradio
